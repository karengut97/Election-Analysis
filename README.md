# Election-Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has provided the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.8.8, Visual Studio Code, 1.57.1

## Summary of Findings
The analysis of the election show that:
- There were 369,711 votes cast in this election.
- The candidates were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham
  - Diana DeGette
  - Raymon Anthony Doanne
- The results were:

| Candidate | % of Votes Won | # of Votes Won |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
|Charles Casper Stockham| 23.0% | 85,213 |
|Diana DeGette| 73.8% | 272,892 |
|Raymon Anthony Doanne| 3.1% | 11,606 |

- The winner of the election was:
  -  Diana DeGette with 272,892 votes with 73.8% of all votes cast.

## Challenge Overview
This challenge demostrated the speed at which code can evaluate large amounts of data. Using an election results csv file, python was able to rapidly assess the data and summarize the findings. 

## Challenge Summary
Key takaways from this challenge included:
* Python's indention is critical to sequence of actions in the code. This differs greatly from other languages, such as Java, where curly braces enclose blocks of code.
* Python is an easy language to learn, the syntax makes sense.
* Visual Studio Code is a powerful IDE tool as it provides inline debugging identification.
